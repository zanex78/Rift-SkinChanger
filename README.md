Rift-SkinChanger
This is a simple skinchager for the Fortnite project rift.
You can find the discord under https://discord.gg/riftfn

DISCLAMER:
Understand that this project is NEVER going to be open source since I (zanexGHG) want to protect my code.
If you don't trust me you can see the Virustotal scan down below.
I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSE FOR ANY BANS OR ANYTHING. (just in case someone gets banned because of it I don't know.)

How to use:
To use it download Rift-SkinChanger.exe, double-click (You don't have to run it as admin!!!) and then wait for it to load, press enter,
accept the cookies on the web panel I made for it, chose your skin, pickaxe, emotes, gliders, loading screens, music and trail and enjoy!!!
(Banners will be added later on)

Virustotal:
If you don't trust the screenshot either you can just download the program as a zip and copy that into Virustotal.
For those who are not familiar with all the different antivirus systems: The most trustable ones are BitDefender, Trendmicro,
Kaspersky(I don't know if It's still trustable it has been proven as very good in the past), Malwarebytes and so on...
And if you still wonder why Trapmine detects it as "Suspicious.low.ml.score", that is how it is because it opens the web panel in your default browser, 
so it needs to access another program which is not liked by some antivirus programs.
